Solarized
=========

## Precision colors for machines and people

[![solarized dualmode](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/raw/master/img/solarized-yinyang.png)](#features)

Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors)
designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several [unique
properties](#features). I designed this colorscheme with both precise
[CIELAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) lightness relationships
and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been
tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as
uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting
conditions.
